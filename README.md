# CineMango_CSE308 #

This was a group project for my Software Enginerring(CSE 308). It used Java EE (JSP, Servlets, JPA) and front end technologies such as JSTL, Javascript (AJAX, and JQuery).

### CineMango ###
  CineMango is a reverse engineered java EE web application version of the Fandango website. It is a movie ticket purchasing site with many movies, theaters and showtimes at these theaters
### Set Up ###
* Clone the project and make sure you have the JPA, java mail zip files. If you're using tomcat make sure you have the necessary zip file for running core JSTL.
* Database configuration: This project uses a MYSQL server (remote from Stony Brook University) and requires the JDBC.
